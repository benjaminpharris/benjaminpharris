## *Hi, I’m Ben.*  
My non-exhaustive list of self-identifiers includes:
- **Data scientist**, because it’s the easiest shorthand
- **Finance-fluent**, with a bias toward rigor and realism
- Physics enthusiast (what is a spinor?)
- ~~Casual~~ _Semi-casual_ car guy (~~Papaya~~ RB 2025, ~~M440i~~ '16 WRX)
- Data deliberator and structured thinker (in matrix, dataframe, database, or spreadsheet)
- Math enjoyer, LaTeX loyalist, and fan of clean derivations
- Wine drinker, caffeine-fiend, and occasional techno philosopher (usually in conjunction with one of the former)
- Yoga do-er, sometimes for balance, often for sanity
- Nerd (closeted and celebrated)
- Bayesian modeling dabbler, priors welcome
- Python programmer (out of necessity and joy - why can't I reassign in a loop)
- R programmer (out of joy)
- Book reader, knowledge hoarder, and probably overthinking something right now
