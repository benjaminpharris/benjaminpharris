## Hi, I’m Ben — and my non-exhaustive list of self-identifiers includes:
- **Data scientist**, because it’s the easiest shorthand
- **Finance-fluent**, with a bias toward rigor and realism
- Physics enthusiast (what is a spinor?)
- Casual car guy (~~Papaya~~ RB 2025, M440i, daily smirk)
- Data deliberator and structured thinker (in matrix, dataframe, database, or spreadsheet)
- Math enjoyer, LaTeX loyalist, and fan of clean derivations
- Wine drinker, caffeine-fiend, and occasional techno philosopher (usually in conjunction with one of the former)
- Yoga do-er, sometimes for balance, often for sanity
- Nerd (closeted and celebrated)
- Bayesian modeling dabbler — priors welcome
- Python programmer (out of necessity and joy)
- R programmer (out of joy)
- Book reader, knowledge hoarder, and probably overthinking something right now
- Also: pro forma builder, modeling maximalist, and finder of false tradeoffs
